    <h3 id="what-vr"> Virtual Reality: What its About</h3>
      <p>Virtual Reality is about the use of computer technology to create a stimulated environment. This includes user experiencing the five senses, vision, hearing, touch, and smell. 3 key takeaways of the VR experience include: 
        <ul>
          <li class="lists">Immersion: VR headsets allow the user to fully immerse to another world.</li>
          <li class="lists">Sensory feedback: User moving their heads or bodies will give an illusion of them moving in the virtual world. </li>
          <li class="lists">Interactivity: A stimulated environment should include virutal elements where the user can interact with.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Advantages of using VR</h4>
        <p class="text"> The benefits of VR in the medical field introduce an idea whereby this tool is helpful for both patients and doctors. The first advantage is, virtual reality can elevate the teaching and learning experience in medicine. This means medical students can learn to understand medical concepts better through visual forms. A second advantage is, virtual reality can help relax patients before and after medical procedures. Let's say a patient has a high-risk surgery and is very nervous about it. The use of VR headsets can help distract them even during the surgery. One last advantage is, virtual reality helps to speed up recovery in physical therapy. 
           <h4> Disadvantages of using VR</h4> 
          <p class="text">Going into the disadvantages of VR in the medical field. These include side effects to the cost of virtual reality tools. The first disadvantage is the side effects of virtual reality. Patients can have cybersickness or simulation sickness where they spend too much time in the VR world. Another disadvantage is safety parameters. This means the lack of distinction between the virtual vs. real environment over time. The last advantage there is about using VR, is the cost of it. The specs for the hardware and software of VR can be too expensive. </p>
      <h4>Examples of VR in the Medical Field</h4>
      <p class="text">
        Before going into some real-life examples of how virtual reality is helpful. One interesting fact about VR in the medical field is: the 1st VR surgery was done back in 2016 by Dr. Shafi Ahmed. 3 examples of VR in the medical field are: 
        <ul class="lists">
          <li class="lists">Medical students at Case Western University are being taught with HoloLens about: human anatomy.</li>
          <li class="lists">Recent pilot study: St. Georgeâ€™s hospital (London) used VR headset before & after operation. </li>
          <li class="lists">Teaming up with physicians & therapists: Neuro Rehab VR Corporation develops VR training exercises with machine learning to modify to patients needs.</li>

    <h3 id="sports-field">VR in Sports Field</h3>
      <h4 class="subheaders">General Information</h4>
        <p class="text">VR allows for user's to experience a very immersive scenario, this is no different in the sports world. Atheletes may be in the safety of their own home and still be able to experience the same feeling they get on the field, court, track, or ring. Especially during COVID-19, this has been a driving force in atheletes' lives.</p>
      <h4 class="subheaders">Football</h4>
        <h5 class="subheaders">The 3 Main Uses of VR in Football<h5>
          <ul>
            <li class="lists">Film</li>
            <li class="lists">Training</li>
            <li class="lists">Concussion Protocols</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="text">In the NFL there are cameras everywhere. The advantage of this is that with machine learning, there's software that is able to stitch together all of the camera angles so you're able to get a 360 degree view of plays. These plays can then be played through in a VR headset and players can then replay the exact scenario they were faced with. They can be used to learning moments. In the NFL the difference from the good teams and bad teams are in the way they play.</p>
        <p class="text">Through the film provided to them in VR, player's can train near game like conditions in the safety of their home/training facility. If players can elevate their game any way possible then they'll leap at the opportunity.</p>
        <p class="text">Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a big problem in the NFL. CTE is a big problem in the NFL because of the repeated head blows that players face on a regular basis. To combat this, the NFL is always changing concussion protocols in order to protect the safety of the players. Concussion testing has always been a little wishy-washy, but the use of VR may alleviate the pressure. Team doctors may put players through a baseline test in order to gauge what their brain activity is like in certain test scenarios. If a player experience any extreme trauma to the head in game, team doctors will put them through the same test to see if they're fit to keep playing.</p>
      <h4 class="subheaders">Soccer<h4>
        <p class="text">Some Soccer clubs have already implemented VR in their training regimine. During COVID-19 players were able to practice with each other to reduce the negative effects of isolation. Players would place motion sensors around their living room that would be connected to the VR headsets. Players would also have sensors on their feet/legs that would have haptic feedback when they kicked a ball. <a href="https://rezzil.com/home-us/">Rezzil</a> is a tech company that is leading the charge in this department.<p>
      <h4 class="subheaders">Golf</h4>
        <h5 class="subheaders">The 3 Main Uses of VR in Golf<h5>
          <ul>
            <li class="lists">Analysis</li>
            <li class="lists">Testing</li>
            <li class="lists">Practice</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="text">Golfers are able to run simulations while wearing motion capture suits. The suits will be able to capture the data of a golfer's movements. In golf, even minimal changes in movements may alter the shot path of a swing. In order to combat this, golfers may see analysis of their swings and gain knowledge of what the most optimal swing is and they can just repeat it over and over again.</p>
        <p class="text">Golfers may also test different clubs, irons, putters, etc. If they ever think about switching clubs they don't have to go out and buy them. They'll still be holding these clubs in their hands, they just won't be swinging at a physical ball which may damage the club.</p>
        <p class="text">Not everyone has the privilege of living in perfect conditions for a course. There is now the option of playing on real golf courses in the safety of your home. These simulations with prove to be nearly identical to the real life courses.</p>
      <h5 class="subheaders">Main Takeaways</h5>
        <ul>
          <li class="lists">Protects the safety of players</li>
          <li class="lists">Ability to view plays from any angle</li>
          <li class="lists">Better analysis capabilities</li>
          <li class="lists">Possibility to try new plays/strategies without the risk of in game repercussions</li>

<h3 id="pd-mil-field">VR in Law Enforcement/Military</h3>
        <h4> Background</h4>
        <p class="text"> VR in law enforcement:
As the demands on police officers continue to climb, the need for training to match that demand becomes increasingly necessary. Currently, most law enforcement agencies rely heavily on reality-based training, using physical spaces and actors to create scenarios for training. The problem is these scenarios are cost-prohibitive because they require to pay actors and a number of physical spaces used for training purposes. Through virtual reality police training, SURVIVOR is able to provide similar training without the confines of actors or training sites.</p><br>
<p class="text">VR in Military:
1980's Military simulators were in use during the Cold War, but it was not until the 1980's those computers were first introduced into this simulator. Modern flight simulators make use of the very latest in virtual reality technology for training purposes. One example is linked to the development of flight simulators a well-established training tool for new pilots which has embraced virtual reality. These simulators are used to train pilots to fly in a combat situation which often involves dealing with an emergency as well as learning to handle an aircraft under extreme circumstances. Modern flight simulators make use of the very latest in virtual reality technology for training purposes. Flight simulators were extended to include other military vehicles such as tanks, submarines, ships, and jeeps. These are used by all branches of the services and as support not a replacement for traditional training methods.</p>
<h4> Advantage</h4>
<p class="text"> Law enforcement:
Virtual Reality Training immerses learners in a digital environment where they encounter real-life scenarios that test their knowledge without facing real-world risk. Regardless of what you use VR training for, there are overarching advantages and disadvantages 
<ul>
  <li class="lists">Creates a Safe Learning Environment</li>
  <li class="lists">Exciting and Engaging</li>
  <li class="lists">Realistic Technical Skills Practice</li>
  <li class="lists">Collects Key Training Metrics</li>
</ul></p>
<p class="text"> Military:
One of the key advantages of virtual reality is the ability to immerse users in a virtual, yet safe, world. This is ideal for applications in the defense sector, providing military personal and defense contractors a way to gain valuable experience of dangerous or life-threatening environments from the safety of a training room. Virtual reality is a technology based on the idea of artificially not naturally immersing oneself in reality. VR is finally a reality but there are some advantages. Some of the main advantages appear below:
<ul>
  <li class="lists">Better than reality: Visuals seen in visual reality are far better than reality. Virtual reality technology is used in video games and the user gets a feeling that he is in another world.</li>
  <li class="lists"> Used in various fields: Due to its extensive features, virtual reality has been used in different fields such as in the military, education, and health care.</li>
  <li class="lists"> Users have awesome experiences: Users have tremendous experiences in using virtual reality. The VR technology makes users feel that they experience the real locations and hearing the real sounds and seeing real things. Many people have the feeling to use more and more virtual reality technology. It is highly reckoned by disabled people.</li>
<li class="lists"> Give details views:  Virtual reality gives a full and detailed view of a place. For example, virtual reality makes tourism sites more interesting and easier. It gives a detailed view of a place where you want to visit.</li>
<li class="lists">Connects with people: Virtual reality gives you the chance to communicate with people you do not know in your real life. It helps in forming new relationships in a more efficient manner as compared to real life.</li>
<li class="lists">Effective communication: One of the main pros of Virtual reality is effective communication. Users can communicate with each other and thus enjoy the conversation between them.</li> </ul> </p>
<h4> Disadvantage:</h4>
<p class="text"> Law enforcement: 
Live combat and situations awareness training has always been critical to law enforcement in the creation of competent and well-rounded officers, but it comes with some very obvious disadvantages. There is a very high cost attached to each training session, the possibility of physical harm that can take a prolonged period of time to heal from and the inherent.
<ul>
  <li class="lists">Physical Side Effects</li>
  <li class="lists">Technology Developments and Updates</li>
  <li class="lists">High Cost</li> </ul>
  <p class="text"> Military 
    <ul>
      <li class="lists">Hight cost: One of the main cons of virtual games is that it is not possible for everyone to afford them. It is too costly and people who cannot afford these will be left out from using this technology.</li>
      <li class="lists"> Communication should not be replaced for group of peoples:  Another con of virtual reality is that communication using this technology should not be replaced for groups of people.</li>
      <li class="lists"> Feeling of worthlessness:  The users of virtual reality many times get a feeling of worthlessness.</li>
      <li class="lists">Users an addict to the virtual world:  The users get addicted to the virtual world and navigate the nonvirtual environment. </li> 
      <li class="lists"> Technology is still experimental: Though virtual reality technology is used in various fields but is still experimental.</li>
      <li class="lists"> 	Training in VR environment is not real:  Another con of virtual reality is that a person who has been trained in a VR environment may do well in that environment, but he cannot perform well in the real world.</li>
<h4>Project</h4>
      <p class="text"> SIMULATE: VR allows military personnel to undertake a huge range of simulations, without the associated costs, thus massively reducing training budgets. VR can put a trainee in any number of different places, situations, or environments, and can be used to teach awareness, build skills, and provide valuable experience to help when real life requires it.<br>
<br>
IMMERSIVE TRAINING:  trainees could use VR to experience a parachute jump, gaining an awareness of the sensation and disorientation of jumping from an aircraft, without the associated real world flight costs. They can be placed in fighter jets, submarines, tanks, or armored vehicles to experience the cramped and claustrophobic conditions or placed in the middle of an active battlefield or patrolled through an environment, learning how to locate enemy soldiers or search for IEDs. <br>
<br>
TOTAL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT: The class VR headsets are stand alone and require no physical connection to PCs, thus enabling the user to move freely whilst wearing them. Their content can be stored locally on devices so no network or wireless connection is required, allowing them to be used in any location.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL APPLICATIONS: VR can also be used more passively, to help treat PTSD or provide â€˜boot campâ€™ experience to new recruits, helping them adapt quickly, and with less anxiety to military life. Medics can view field surgery and front-line triage, helping them understand and empathies with injured patients.</p>
